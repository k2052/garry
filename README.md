# What is Garry?

Garry is an asshole. Garry likes doing things his own way. He likes to buy things but he only buys them through Stripe.

Garry is an ecommerce framework using padrino, mongomapper and stripe. Like a great imaginary friend Garry helps keep me from writing extra code and repeating myself (which one often does when talking to oneself or when writing code). 

Garry isn't that special but he sure is useful.
